Concepts like nutrition or supplements were foreign to them, for they had been raised on foods that came from their backyard gardens and neighbors&#8217; organic farms. They relied on local, natural foods and homegrown herbal remedies crafted with transgenerational wisdom to treat illnesses and nourish their bodies, never having to worry about whether they were getting the nutrients they needed. Not long after arriving in the United States, Snap Supplements Co-Founder Max began noticing how the standard Western diet &#8220;full of processed foods and lacking in quality nutrients&#8221; was negatively affecting his family&#8217;s health. As his family experienced weight gain, allergies, and heart diseases so common in the Western world, Max was inspired to begin his journey sharing how food could be used as medicine.
